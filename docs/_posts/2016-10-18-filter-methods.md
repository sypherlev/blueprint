Filter methods store the query elements below, and can be applied to a Query when the Filter is used.

All methods below are analogues to those of the same name in the Blueprint class.

* where
* orderBy
* limit

### setQueryParams
 
| Parameters   | QueryInterface $query  |
| Returns      | $query |

This function causes the Filter's settings to be applied to the $query.

This is normally only used in the main Blueprint class and can be ignored.
